# andig/beats4pi

Docker image to build elastic/beats for Raspberry Pi

## Customizing

The image has a couple of ENV vars that can be used for customizing what and how to build:

  - `GOARCH=arm` - the target architecture, arm for RaspberryPi
  - `GOARM=7` - ARM architecture version - 7 for RasperryPi 3
  - `BEATS=filebeat,metricbeat` - comma-separated list of beats to compile
  - `BEATS_VERSION=6.1.1` - version to compile

## Building elastic beats

    docker run -v $(pwd):/beats -e BEATS_VERSION=6.0.1 andig/beats4pi
    
## Other

To test the build script without re-downloading elastic/beats you can clone it once and then map the cloned folder into the image:

    git clone https://github.com/elastic/beats
    docker run -v $(pwd)/beats/:/go/src/github.com/elastic/beats beats4pi

See https://gist.github.com/andig/650915e02b18cfe38de6516686977bca for an approach how to manually build beats with the various configurations required natively on a RaspberryPi 3.
